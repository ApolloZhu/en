So my [profile images](https://gravatar.com/apollonyan) are usually <strong style="color:white;background-color:#66ccff;border-radius:5px;padding:0 10px;">white on #66CCFF</strong>, sometimes in grayscale to commemorate some one or something special. But I do seldomly design special editions for special occasions, such as:

| ![Qixi Festival](https://1.gravatar.com/userimage/102369060/7a4e6483b100f709b2f946efac552807?size=400) | {% note info %} #### 2018/08/16 | Qixi (Chinese Valentine's Day)
Why not red? In Chinese culture love is not that straightforward, a softer color like this conveys that idea better. And it so happens to align with the blue-pink-white color scheme, fine. {% endnote %} |
| ![Halloween](https://0.gravatar.com/userimage/102369060/9cd71fbab01a73f61d87c4c2deb7ffc2?size=400) | {% note primary %} #### 2018/10/31 | Halloween
Yeah, I know, I just changed the color. If I have time, I'll add cats, pumpkins, bats, etc. If I have time.{% endnote %} |
| ![Luck in Year of the Pig](https://0.gravatar.com/userimage/102369060/1f3a207839546b73b8510862b4a724c2?size=400) | {% note danger %} #### 2019/02/04 | Á¶è in Year of the Pig
This morphs the Chinese character Á¶è (upside down) into my initials (AZ). Took me a while to come up with this--honestly speaking--excellent design. It even has a tiny pig tail! {% endnote %} |
| ![WWDC Neon](https://2.gravatar.com/userimage/102369060/e6ee18c8271a2308eb6d923afcff4fa3?size=400) | {% note primary %} #### 2019/05/30 | WWDC19
I happened to learn how to make Neon effect in computer graphics class. But unfortunately, me winning their [Scholarships](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/scholarships/) that year didn't happen. {% endnote %} |
| ![Christmas](https://0.gravatar.com/userimage/102369060/05c1c03e86fc67e97254865522bd104a?size=400)| {% note danger %} #### 2019/12/18 | Christmas
Back in 2017 people were putting xmas hats on their avatars, so I made one with fluffy xmas hat. But it didn't look that well, so I made this one in Keynote using their shapes library. {% endnote %} |
| ![PornHub](https://2.gravatar.com/userimage/102369060/6546a6c107774206bdb5adb2013b2235?size=400)| {% note warning %} #### 2020/03/27 | Stayhome hub
Due to COVID-19 Coronavirus, they made pro accounts free. My username was taken so I had to use [Apollonyan](https://www.pornhub.com/users/apollonyan). Not that I'm gonna use the account or anything; My fear is for someone using my name to do bad things. {% endnote %} |
| ![Pride](https://2.gravatar.com/userimage/102369060/1095e598c5f595819cff42f5d4e47157?size=400)| {% note success %} #### 2020/06/01 | Pride üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
So this is my second attempt. I tried to make one of these on my birthday 2 years ago, but the result didn't turn out too well. Though I like this sticker kind of look and feel, will probably release a better design in the future. {% endnote %} |
