Congratulations.

<!-- more -->

I know you have so many questions and concerns about future. You used to think you know what exactly you want to study, but as you learned more (about CSE and yourself), you start to realize how little you know, and how many things you want to explore. I can’t give you an answer as to exactly what’s the right direction, but I know one thing you should always do: taking a step forward, no matter how small.

Right now, the world is quite crazy, and people are divided. You should never let negative feelings overwhelm you and widen the gap between communities. And remember, though been an effective tool, technology is not the golden key to every problem. It’s gonna be hard, but that’s fine. Just never give up.

Sincerely,
