{% note warning %}

This is intended for contributors outside of K Desktop Environment e.V. development group to test their code on a physical device before opening a merge request. This process should theoretically work even if you don't have a paid Apple Developer account, though I've never tested.

1. Download KDE Connect iOS source code from KDE Invent
2. Open `KDE Connect.xcodeproj` in Xcode
   1. In `Build Settings` for target `KDE Connect`, delete `Code Signing Entitlements` (but do not delete the entitlements file)
   2. In `Singing & Capabilities` for target `KDE Connect`, change the `Team` and `Bundle Identifier` so the project builds for `Any iOS Device`.
   3. In `Products` folder, right click on `KDE Connect` (which shouldn't be red) and select `Show In Finder`
2. In terminal, navigate to the folder containing `KDE Connect.xcodeproj`
3. In terminal, type the following commands ***line by line*** (other than comments starting with `#`). See [References](#references) section about what each of these lines do:
   ```sh
   build=#drag the KDE Connect.app here from Finder
   security cms -D -i "$build/embedded.mobileprovision" > provision.plist
   name=$(basename "`pwd`")
   /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -x -c 'Print:Entitlements' provision.plist > entitlements.plist
   # Note that extra ' is added because name contains whitespace in path
   /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -x -c "Merge '$name/$name.entitlements'" entitlements.plist
   # Replace `YOUR NAME (TEAM)` with the actual value of your Apple Development Certificate name (found in KeyChain Access)
   codesign -d --entitlements entitlements.plist -f -s "Apple Development: YOUR NAME (TEAM)" $build
   ```
4. Place the `KDE Connect.app` in a folder named `Payload`, zip the `Payload` folder, and (re)name it `KDE Connect.ipa`
5. Install self-signed `KDE Connect.ipa` on your own physical device for testing (requires jailbreaking or apps like Sideloadly)
