## Linguistics

I learned from LING 200 - Introduction To Linguistics that:

{% centerquote %}

In different languages that make use of grammatical gender, the expressions that refer to the same thing may be assigned to a different gender class. Thus, the word that means book is masculine in French (le livre), neuter in German (das Buch), and feminine in Russian (книга). Therefore, grammatical gender is an *arbitrary* system of classification.

**Language Files: Materials for an Introduction to Language and Linguistics**

{% endcenterquote %}

So, according to my "extensive research" (i.e. searching Google for a few minutes without further verification nor citing my sources):

- In Spanish, the colloquial word for penis is feminine and the colloquial word for vagina is masculine
   - The majority of Spanish slang terms for penis are feminine nouns
- In French, bite is slang for penis... and it is feminine
- ...

Therefore, we can conclude that there exists feminine penis. $\square$

## Pronoun

{% note info %}

**Disclaimer**: I'm including this section because "she" is "used to refer to a woman, girl, or female animal..." and "feminine" means "having qualities or an appearance traditionally associated with women." However, the use of pronoun "she" has no direct association with "been feminine."

{% endnote %}

It appears that people use the pronoun "she" for ships and countries (even "我的祖国母亲" in Mandarin), but [Do You Refer to Your Penis as He or She?](https://www.giantbomb.com/forums/off-topic-31/do-you-refer-to-your-penis-as-he-or-she-541270/) This is left as an exercise for the reader.
