And at such a moment, unable to see and not daring to imagine what the future will now bring forth, one clings to what one knew, or thought one knew; to what one possessed or dreamed that one possessed. Yet, it is only when a man is able, without bitterness or self-pity, to surrender a dream he has long cherished or a privilege he has long possessed that he is set free—he has set himself free—for higher dreams, for greater privileges.</p>\n<footer><strong>James Baldwin</strong><cite><span style=font-style:normal>“Faulkner and Desegregation”</span>Nobody Knows My Name</cite></footer></blockquote>\n",
